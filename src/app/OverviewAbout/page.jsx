                I'm a Math-Computer Science major at UC San Diego with a strong
                interest in software engineering, AI, and music tech. Whether
                it's building web apps for robotics teams, training neural
                networks to convert polyphonic music into piano reductions, or
                deploying real-time computer vision projects, I love applying
                technology to solve creative and meaningful problems.
